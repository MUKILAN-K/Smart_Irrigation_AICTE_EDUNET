ðŸ“Œ **Week 1**  
**Week 1 Goal:**  
- Load the given dataset (`irrigation_machine.csv`)
- Inspect the data: check rows, columns, info, data types, and basic statistics
- Drop unnecessary columns
- Define features (X) and labels (y)
- View samples and shapes of the data

âœ… **File:**  
`smart_irrigation.ipynb` â€” Notebook with all Week 1 code  
(Written and tested in VS Code)

ðŸ“Œ **How to run:**  
- Clone the repository  
- Make sure `irrigation_machine.csv` is in the same folder  
- Open the notebook and run all cells

ðŸ“Œ **Week 2**  
**Week 2 Goal:**  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Train the model and get accuracy score
- Evaluate the model
- Save the model as `.pkl` file

âœ… **File:**
